    There are Checked and Unchecked Exceptions.

    We can create our own custom exceptions by extending the ExceptionClass.
    We can handle exceptions using try catch and finally blocks.
    We can use raise keyword to raise the Exception.
    We can use the super(messageInString) to call the constructor of the parent class (Exception class)
    and pass on the message.
